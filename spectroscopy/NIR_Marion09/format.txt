; data are in marion_dat format
; each file has 8 columns: l, f, er, ff, lz, fn, ern, ffn
; l=observed wavelength (angstroms)
; f=raw flux (ergs/s/cm^2/A)
; er=error estimate by pixel
; ff= Fourier transform smoothed spectrum
; lz=wavelength shifted to rest frame of host (lz=l/(1+z))
; fn, ern, & ffn are the normalized raw data (f, ff, & er)
; normalization makes ffn=1.0 at 1.0 microns for NIR data
; normalization makes ffn=1.7 at 7300 A for optical data

For most analysis it is easiest to look at the normalized, 
smoothed data (ffn) plotted against the redshift 
adjusted wavelength (lz).
